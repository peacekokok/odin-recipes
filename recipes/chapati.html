        <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>Chapati is a widely cooked dish with origins from India. Through the Arab
        Trade, chapati was brought to Eastern Africa. I like many Kenyans have grown up
        with a sweeter version of Chapati than the one available in India. The recipe below
        will outline the Kenyan version of chapati.
